when using github's Team collaboration features ,I come to know these many options are there to manage a project with the single tool Github. Github is very helpful and made me learn how industries use Github to make people coordinate or work  together in a same project which can monitored on a single platform with all these helpfull steps.By now I only know basic and hadn't faced any challange but introduction to this tech tool will help get better with the industrial atmosphere and team collaboration.
